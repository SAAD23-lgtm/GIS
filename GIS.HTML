      <h2> <u>what is this!!!!!!!!! </h2></u> <img src="C:\Users\Hello\Desktop\images.jpg" alt="">
     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><b> <h3>##This is the premise that led to the emergence of geographic information systems: </a> 
       </h3>
    </b></i>
    <p>- In the middle 1800s, people didn’t have running water or
        modern toilets in their homes. They used town wells and
        communal pumps to get the water they used for drinking,
        cooking and washing. Septic systems were primitive and
        most homes and businesses dumped untreated sewage and
        animal waste directly into the Thames River or into open pits called
        “cesspools”. Water companies often bottled water from the Thames and
        delivered it to pubs, breweries and other businesses.
        Dr. Snow believed sewage dumped into the river or into cesspools near town
        wells could contaminate the water supply, leading to a rapid spread of disease</p>
        <p>- In August of 1854 Soho, a suburb of London, was hit hard by a terrible outbreak of cholera. Dr. Snows
            himself lived near Soho, and immediately went to work to prove his theory that contaminated water was
            the cause of the outbreak</p>

            <p>- Within 250 yards of the spot where Cambridge Street joins Broad Street there were upwards of 500
                fatal attacks of cholera in 10 days,” Dr. Snow wrote “As soon as I became acquainted with the
                situation and extent of this irruption (sic) of cholera, I suspected some contamination of the water of the
                much-frequented street-pump in Broad Street.</p>
                                  <p>- Dr. Snow worked around the clock to track down information from hospital and public records on when
                                    the outbreak began and whether the victims drank water from the Broad Street pump. Snow suspected
                                    that those who lived or worked near the pump were the most likely to use the pump and thus, contract
                                    cholera. His pioneering medical research paid off. By using a geographical grid to chart deaths from
                                    the outbreak and investigating each case to determine access to the pump water, Snow developed
                                    what he considered positive proof the pump was the source of the epidemic.

                                        <h3>  <center><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">About Dr. Snow </a></p></center>  </h3> 
                                         
                                              <p>Besides those who lived near the pump, Snow tracked hundreds of cases of cholera to nearby schools,
                                                restaurants, businesses and pubs.
                                                According to Snow’s records, the keeper of one coffee shop in the neighborhood who served glasses
                                                of water from the Broad Street pump along with meals said she knew of nine of her customers who had
                                                contracted cholera.</p>
                                               <p> A popular bubbly drink of the time was called “sherbet”, which was a spoonful of powder that fizzed
                                                when mixed with water. In the Broad Street area of Soho, that water usually came from the Broad
                                                Street pump and was, Snow believed, the source for many cases.
                                                Snow also investigated groups of people who did not get cholera and tracked down whether they drank
                                                pump water. That information was important because it helped Snow rule out other possible sources of
                                                the epidemic besides pump water.
                                                He found several important examples. A workhouse, or prison, near Soho had 535 inmates but almost
                                                no cases of cholera. Snow discovered the workhouse had its own well and bought water from the
                                                Grand Junction Water Works.</p>
                                                       <ul> The men who worked in a brewery on Broad Street which made malt liquor also
                                                        escaped getting cholera. The proprietor of the brewery, Mr. Huggins, told Snow
                                                        that the men drank the liquor they made or water from the brewery’s own well and
                                                        not water from the Broad Street pump. None of the men contracted cholera. A
                                                        factory near the pump, at 37 Broad Street, wasn’t so lucky. The factory kept two
                                                        tubs of water from the pump on hand for employees to drink and 16 of the workers
                                                        died from cholera.</ul>
                                                        <p><ul> The cases of two women, a niece and her aunt, who died of cholera puzzled
                                                            Snow. The aunt lived some distance from Soho, as did her niece, and Snow could make no connectionArcGIS Pro Essential Workflows Section 1 Introduction to GIS Day 1 GIS Definitions 4
                                                            to the pump. The mystery was cleared up when he talked to the woman’s son. He told Snow that his
                                                            mother had lived in the Broad Street area at one time and liked the taste of the water from the pump so
                                                            much that she had bottles of it brought to her regularly. Water drawn from the pump on 31 August, the
                                                            day of the outbreak, was delivered to her. As was her custom, she and her visiting niece took a glass of
                                                            the pump water for refreshment, and according to Snow’s records, both died of cholera the following day.
                                                            Snow was able to prove that the cholera was not a problem in Soho except among people who were in
                                                            the habit of drinking water from the Broad Street pump. He also studied samples of water from the pump
                                                            and found white flecks floating in it, which he believed were the source of contamination.
                                                            On 7 September 1854, Snow took his research to the town officials and convinced them to take the
                                                            handle off the pump, making it impossible to draw water. The officials were reluctant to believe him, but
                                                            took the handle off as a trial only to find the outbreak of cholera almost immediately trickled to a
                                                            stop. Little by little, people who had left their homes and businesses in the Broad Street area out of fear
                                                            of getting cholera began to return.</ul></p>
                                                                    <center><img src="C:\Users\Hello\Desktop\ee.PNG" alt=""></center>
                                                - Despite the success of Snow’s theory in stemming the cholera epidemic in Soho,
                                                public officials still thought his hypothesis was nonsense. They refused to do
                                                anything to clean up the cesspools and sewers. The Board of Health issued a report
                                                that said, “we see no reason to adopt this belief” and shrugged off Snow’s evidence
                                                as mere “suggestions.”
                                                For months afterward Snow continued to track every case of cholera from the 1854
                                                Soho outbreak and traced almost all of them back to the pump, including a
                                                cabinetmaker who was passing through the area and children who lived closer to
                                                other pumps but walked by the Broad Street pump on their way to school. What he
                                                couldn’t prove was where the contamination came from in the first place.
                                                Officials contended there was no way sewage from town pipes leaked into the pump
                                                and Snow himself said he couldn’t figure out whether the sewage came from open sewers, drains
                                                underneath houses or businesses, public pipes or cesspools.
                                                The mystery might never have been solved except that a
                                                minister, Reverend Henry Whitehead, took on the task of
                                                proving Snow wrong. The minister contended that the
                                                outbreak was caused not by tainted water, but by God’s
                                                divine intervention. He did not find any such proof and in
                                                fact, his published report confirms Snow’s findings. Best of
                                                all, it gave Snow the probable solution to the cause of the pump’s contamination
                                         
                                                            <img src="C:\Users\Hello\Desktop\12942_2015_11_Fig2_HTML.png" alt="">
                                                           <p>Reverend Whitehead interviewed a woman, who lived at 40 Broad Street, whose child who had
                                                            contracted cholera from some other source. The child’s mother washed the baby’s diapers in water
                                                            which she then dumped into a leaky cesspool just three feet from the Broad Street pump, touching off
                                                            what Snow called “the most terrible outbreak of cholera which ever occurred in this kingdom.”
                                                            A year later a magazine called The Builder published Reverend Whitehead’s findings along with a
                                                            challenge to Soho officials to close the cesspool and repair the sewers and drains because “in spite of
                                                            the late numerous deaths, we have all the materials for a fresh epidemic.” It took many years before
                                                            public officials made those improvements.</p>
                                                            <img src="C:\Users\Hello\Desktop\Capture.PNG" alt="">
                                                          <p> <ul>In 1883 a German physician, Robert Koch, took the search for the cause of cholera a step further when
                                                            he isolated the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, the “poison” Snow contended caused cholera. Dr. Koch
                                                            determined that cholera is not contagious from person to person, but is spread only through unsanitary
                                                            water or food supply sources, a major victory for Snow’s theory. The cholera epidemics in Europe and
                                                            the United States in the 19th century ended after cities finally improved water supply sanitation.
                                                            The World Health Organization estimates 78 percent of the people in Third World countries are still
                                                            without clean water supplies today, and up to 85 percent of those people don’t live in areas with adequate
                                                            sewage treatment, making cholera outbreaks an ongoing concern in some parts of the world.
                                                            Today, scientists consider Snow to be the pioneer of public health research in a field known as
                                                            epidemiology. Much of the current epidemiological research done at the U.S. Centers for Disease
                                                            Control, which still uses theories such as Snows’ to track the sources and causes of many diseases</ul>

<p><h5>A geographic information system (GIS) is a system that creates, manages, analyzes, and maps all types of data. GIS connects data to a map, integrating location data (where things are) with all types of descriptive information (what things are like there). This provides a foundation for mapping and analysis that is used in science and almost every industry. GIS helps users understand patterns, relationships, and geographic context. The benefits include improved communication and efficiency as well as better management and decision making.
